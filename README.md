# My E-Commerce App

This is a sample e-commerce application with AR/VR integration for trying out clothes.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts: the backend and the frontend.

### Backend

The backend is a Node.js and Express.js application. It provides REST APIs for user registration, login, product listing, and order placement. The data is stored in a MongoDB database.

The backend code is located in the `backend` directory.

### Frontend

The frontend is a React.js application. It provides a user interface for user registration, login, product listing, and shopping cart. It also integrates AR/VR for trying out clothes.

The frontend code is located in the `frontend` directory.
